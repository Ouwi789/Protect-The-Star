## **PROTECT THE STAR - GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT**

### **PLANNING**


#### Organisation 


##### Team responsibilities

To maximise team productivity and collaboration, we have deliberately allocated roles and responsibilities to each team member depending on their strengths, skills and expertise. Our group is composed of individuals with versatile skill sets and capabilities, and this would allow for the different components of the project to be completed with maximum efficiency and to the utmost quality. Furthermore, if a team member is struggling with a particular task, other team members will assist them to the best of their abilities. The assigned roles of each team member are listed below:

##### *Submission guidelines *

To ensure our game meets submission requirements, we will first begin by carefully reading the relevant documents, including the Official Rules, the Classification Guidelines and the Technical Specifications. We will keep this information in mind in the initial designing stage, checking to see that our idea adheres to these submission guidelines, before progressing on with the development of the game.


##### *Workflow*

Firstly, we will decide on what type or genre of game we will design, and then decide on how the game will operate. Subsequently, the title, the overall idea of the game, and the lore will be written, so that we have an idea of what is happening within the game, and can continue to design the game with its fundamentals in mind. 

Once the planning is complete, we will begin designing the game, initially by creating the visual elements within it and then coding them to function as they should according to the lore. We will first focus on the visual elements, and then on the sounds and music of the game through the creation of a theme composition. 

Finally, we will test the game by providing people with a prototype of the game, in which they can experiment with its features and identify bugs or glitches. We will consequently use their feedback to refine our game and patch issues, resulting in a polished and complete game of an overall higher quality. 


##### *Timeline*

Our game should ideally be ready to be tested by Week 8 of the design process so that it is in a satisfactory and playable state for the playtesters to experiment with and provide feedback for. This will also leave enough time for us to patch bugs and refine features that playtesters felt could be improved upon. A week will be allocated in the final stages of the challenge for testing and working on feedback. Our game must be completed by the deadline, which is 22 July.

#### Inspiration and Points of Originality

Within a star’s extremely hot and dense core, nuclear fusion occurs between high-energy hydrogen atoms, forming helium atoms and releasing huge amounts of energy. Gas within the star becomes extremely hot and pushes outward against the inward pull of gravity of the core. This balance of forces is what makes a star, a star. 

Our game will be partly inspired by this concept of endless resistance, and we intend to incorporate elements and gameplay characteristics of a tower defence game, with a civilisation that must oppose and withstand large amounts of alien enemy attacks in order to defend a star. Hydrogen and helium generators extracting their respective gases from the star will be used to synthesise turrets and defence mechanisms.

We have been inspired by other tower defence games, namely Bloons Tower Defence 6, to come up with our game, which will also be a tower defence game. The main concept of tower defence games is to defend a certain object from waves of enemies by implementing numerous defences to fend them off. However, instead of shooting down balloons before they reach the exit like in BTD6, our game will involve shooting down alien invaders before they reach the star.

#### Technical Requirements and Development


##### Development Environment

Our finished product will be able to be played on the Windows operating system, targeting a large player base to access and play our game, as Windows is the predominant operating system. This will be extremely efficient as our game does not involve high-end graphics or processing and Unity already includes an environment to build Windows, meaning that we should be able to port the game over to Windows without considerable difficulty, testing the game as well in order to ensure that it works as intended. 

As previously mentioned, we will be using Unity as our game development platform, to which there are both advantages and disadvantages. Unity stands out for its speed, agility, and user-friendliness and facilitates easy error monitoring and quick fixes to crashes. On the other hand, it may be performance-intensive and consume more memory than other game engines, which limits performance on lower-end devices. However, as our game is not particularly demanding on computer hardware, this would not create a considerable impact. Thus, Unity is an ideal game engine for the development of our game, with its advantages outweighing its disadvantages.

Furthermore, because our game is not performance-intensive, powerful computer hardware is not necessary to play it. This will allow all users on a wide variety of hardware configurations to enjoy the game without performance issues such as lag or stuttering, especially users on lower-end devices. Additionally, to play the game, the player is only required to have a mouse or touchpad in order to interact with, control and navigate through certain elements of the game.


##### Resourcing & Capabilities

We will use Unity to code the game, Blender to design the 3D objects in the game, and finally Reaper to create the music for the game. To effectively develop the game, we require the ability to program and create code, design models on Blender, and create musical compositions that suit the game, which we have honed through many tutorials and practice.


### **DESIGNING**


#### Game Overview


##### *Game *description

Our game will be called “Protect the Star”, and was chosen to reflect the core objective and central theme of the game, which is, as the title suggests, is to use their resourcefulness and cleverness to defend a star from waves of alien invaders. The title thus immediately gives new players an idea of what direction the game will take and the type of gameplay they will encounter. Players will be able to construct hydrogen and helium generators, extracting their respective material from the star, and build defensive turrets using said material to stop the aliens from attacking the star.

*Can you efficiently command the defences of a star? Take the lead in combat, as our star is besieged by alien invaders, and secure the future of our solar system. Utilise different defensive measures to destroy enemies and prevent them from capturing and usurping the energy and lifeblood of our star. *

***Lore*** \
*The aliens of the star Achernar, Achernarians, have discovered the presence of foreign machines from the Xylobloobs (enemy aliens) near the edge of their solar system, and have designed various defensive measures to protect their star from being drained of energy. *

*The battle of Z-5289*

*Our patrol forces near the exoplanet of Z-5289 have intercepted a small task force of Xylobloobers, enemy aliens, spearheading their advance. Almost immediately and totally, the Achernarian spaceships were decimated, leaving behind only a fatal warning message without any survivors. *

*By harnessing the various fuels of Achernar, the Achernarians have developed various blasters of hydrogen and helium to blast laser beams that can effectively destroy the machines in their attempt to gain energy from the star. However, the construction of these cannons is extremely costly, severely limiting their capabilities in combat, and thus requires a supreme coordinator in planning the defence of Achernar. The bulk of the alien machines' army is still approaching, with minor reconnaissance forces approaching the force first. A supreme coordinator is needed to first deal with these scouting machines, who themselves can destroy planets, while also equipping the star with blasters enough so that when the main army arrives in time they can effectively be destroyed for the preservation of the whole solar system. *


##### *Environment*

“Protect the Star” takes place in space around a star, and because it is a 3D game, this would have a significant impact on the gameplay. To handle this unique set of circumstances, we have decided to make the turrets orbit around the star, and allow enemy aliens to attack from any angle. Players will have to actively rotate their view of the star in order to keep track of approaching enemies, resulting in more engaging and active gameplay. 


#### Theme

*The video game theme of 2024 is ‘stars’. Groups must develop a game that incorporates one or more aspects of ‘stars’.*

Our whole game revolves around the theme of a star, as the main objective is to protect a star from invaders. If the invaders in the game defeat the player’s defences, the star will be destroyed, and the game will be lost. However, if the player defeats the aliens, then the star will be saved. Some fundamental knowledge in astrophysics and theory on the composition and nature of stars is used in developing our game. 


#### Gameplay and Mechanics


##### *Objectives/Goals*

The aim of the game is to protect a star from an alien invasion, where the player plays the role of defender in trying to destroy the aliens. In story mode, there will be 10 levels each consisting of 10 waves of alien enemies, each level harder than the last, as aliens come in larger numbers and are more powerful. Players can progress through these harder levels by purchasing buffs and tower upgrades and becoming more experienced at the game. The player’s goal in story mode is to progress through all of the levels by defeating all of the aliens. In infinite mode, the player fends off endless waves of enemies until the star is defeated. The player’s goal is to keep the star alive for as long as possible. Every 10 waves, a special boss enemy, a stronger alien with much higher damage and hitpoints, will spawn, posing more of a threat to the player.

*Labelled and simplified diagram of what a typical round would look like*


##### *Perspective*

The player’s perspective is from a point of view close to and facing the star, and the player can control the screen to gain a full perspective of the star and its surroundings. The game is designed to be 3D, and the player can see a third-person view of the defence of the star. 


##### *Controls*

A player can rotate their view of the star by holding right click on a mouse or touchpad and dragging. Additionally, a player can alter their defence of the star by clicking on it, and then clicking again to confirm the model of the blaster that they will use for the star, or pressing ‘x’ on a keyboard to cancel this command. To interact with any other element of the game, the player can left-click. 


##### *Instructions/Tutorials*

There will be a tutorial feature in our game, which gives new players an introduction to the game’s mechanics, gameplay and rules. It gives them instructions and important knowledge of the game so that they can begin to attempt some of the levels. Furthermore, the first level of our game will also act as a tutorial to introduce new players to the mechanics and controls of the game.


#### Visual and Audio Design


##### *Style*

Our game will incorporate sci-fi cartoonish visual designs to create the different elements of our game and align with contemporary styles of technology. Our platform assets include various objects that resemble spaceships which are attacking a star, while also including the defending cannons. Our audio choices will subsequently convey the extraterrestrial nature of the alien spaceships, which can further enhance the gaming experience as it creates a more immersive experience with the overall theme of a star. The music contains many discordant and rather ominous sounds, to establish the atmosphere of a foreign location, and thus create a better gaming experience. 


##### *Models*

Below are some models of various components that will be used in the game.

##### *Process*

Our group experimented with different styles and assets on Blender, and we effectively tailored our designs to both satisfy the theme of the challenge, while also making the game more exciting and enjoyable to play. Similarly, we took inspiration from multiple compositions and styles, such as the theme music of other sci-fi games or eerie space music, which significantly helped us come up with our musical compositions, and thus gave us an understanding of how to make music fit with a sci-fi game.

### REFLECTION


#### Testing, fixing and project execution


##### Testing

In order to guarantee the quality of our game, we gave copies of ‘Protect the Star’ to five other people including family and friends so that we could receive feedback and criticisms to improve our game. They had no prior experience with it, so their opinion would be coming from the perspective of a new player. We instructed the testers to play the game normally without any interference or assistance from us, so that we could see whether the game was confusing or not, and whether players could understand what was happening. The testers also needed to focus on finding bugs by testing specific aspects of the game, as well as reporting on what they thought were positive and negative or frustrating features of it. Once we analysed the feedback given to us by the testers, we modified the game with respect to their suggested improvements and gave the testers an upgraded version of the game. They then repeated the process so that we could improve quality further.


##### Fixing

Testing our game was imperative to the development process, as it allowed us to fix errors in code ranging from potentially game-breaking glitches to slight bugs that still nonetheless negatively affect player experience. There were visual bugs with components of the GUI, including text overlapping with other components. This was quickly resolved by making GUI components smaller, which also improved the look of the game. There was also a potentially game-breaking glitch where players could receive infinite coins and xp by repeatedly entering and exiting infinite mode. This was due to the variable measuring the rewards being dependent on the wave number, which did not reset every time the player entered the game. Resetting the wave number back to 1 when a player entered the game resolved this issue immediately. There were also glitches to do with the upgrades and perks; instead of increasing the star’s hitpoints, the health upgrade actually decreased it, due to a minor typo in the programming. 

Additionally, gameplay balancing was an issue that had to be addressed. The game was found to be too difficult on the first play test, as it was too hard to kill the aliens due to a lack of resources, and too easy on the second, as it was possible to overplace turrets due to a surplus of resources. This meant that multiple iterations of testing was required to find the perfect balance of difficulty for an enjoyable experience. The gameplay was balanced to its current state by adjusting the rate of output by generators and fire rate of the turrets based on the difficulty of the enemies.

We also added some minor modifications to the game, such as quality-of-life features including a pause menu which was not implemented previously, and small icons indicating which element the platforms corresponded to. Furthermore, the star initially automatically rotated purely as a visual effect, but this conflicted with the fact that the turrets remained locked in their location, so it was decided that the star should stay stationary. Initially in story mode, players could access levels out of order, with the only reason not to skip levels being the difficulty gap. It was agreed that the levels must be completed in order as this made more sense. This issue was solved by making it so that players could only enter a level if they had completed the level before it.


##### Project execution

Ultimately, our team has effectively designed and developed a tower defence game that satisfied the theme of a ‘star’, and have effectively included all required aspects of the 2024 STEM Video Game Challenge. 

During the course of this challenge, most team members have effectively collaborated to develop many aspects of our game, thus maximising its quality. The overall design and coding of the game was executed well according to various reviews, while the music also contributed to the gaming experience that users have with our product. 

Contrastingly, the workload of the project was unevenly distributed between certain team members. This issue was solved through higher productivity rates towards the end of the project, however, next time certain roles would be more enforced to ensure that team members are still contributing their workload to the development of a video game. 

In the next game project our team participates in, we strive to improve our skills in developing the multiple aspects of video games. Individually, team members should be more familiar with the difficulties and challenges that they face with their part of the project, such as processes that enhance the music, using graphic designing tools more effectively, and designing the lore behind the game, thus facilitating a better experience for users.
